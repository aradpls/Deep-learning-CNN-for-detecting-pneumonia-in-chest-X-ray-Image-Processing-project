# Deep-learning-CNN-for-detecting-pneumonia-in-chest-X-ray-Image-Processing-project
repository for  image processing course project

Project By:

Moria Gabay and Arad Peleg  

in this repository You will have access to: 

1.image processing code py file -> (tensor_flow_xray)

2.deep learniing CNN code for detecting pnemunia -> (Deep learning model (CNN) for detecting pnemunia in chest X-ray)

3.images before processing ->

4.images after processing ->

5.Guide to running the code in this read me
