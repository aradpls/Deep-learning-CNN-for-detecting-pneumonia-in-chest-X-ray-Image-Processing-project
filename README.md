<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, this is our deep leraning CNN model for the detection of pnemunia in chest x-aray
   
in this repository You will have access to: 

1.image processing code py file -> tensor_flow_xray

2.deep learning CNN code for detecting pnemunia -> Deep learning model (CNN) for detecting pnemunia in chest X-ray 

-> you can see the outputs on one run of our google collab notebook if you dont need to run it

3.images before processing -> 

4.images after processing -> ChestXrayoutput

5.Guide to running the code in this read me
